  <div>
    <p>In a previous lifetime, I used to blog about all the different things that I've learned or the things that I was working on. At the time, I really enjoyed it
because it provided me a method to support others that were maybe facing the same issues that I was. Additionally, it "forced" me to make sure I really
understood what I was writing about.</p>
<p>During that time, I had a few posts that people seemed to find useful and that was fun. The pinical of that was after I joined Microsoft, I was on a customer
call shadowing another PFE that shared a post from my blog along with a PowerShell script that I wrote.</p>
<p>At this point, it's been several years since I've made a meaningful attempt at blogging or sharing what I'm working on. To the point that when I went to pull my
old blog content down to add as an archive here, I was unable to put all the pieces together. All the 'how-to' images and step by steps are gone. I don't feel
too bad about that as most of the info would have been fairly out of date anyway. Besides, now it gives me an excuse to revisit some of the PowerShell scripts
that I wrote back then to ensure they still work and are appicable. Assuming I actually find the time to follow though with that, I'll have more to post here.
I'm think of a "summary of some useful scripts" or something along those lines. I guess we'll see.</p>
<p>The catalist for spinning this up was two fold: one, I have spent a bit of time working reciently with folks trying to build and publish Microsoft Graph
connectors and I think I have some info that can possibly help there. And two, I've been diving into the "dev" world a bit more reciently and been having fun
solving problems. I though that getting a satic generated site set up and hosted in Github would be a fun challange. I know there are lots of options there, but
the one that seemed to make the most sense to me was <a href="https://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>. Based on Python, it got me the furthest the quickest.</p>
<p>So here I am with a new, empty blog that I can start trying to fill. I'd like to think that I can make it happend, but who knows. I guess stick around and find
out.</p>
