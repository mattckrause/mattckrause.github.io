## Introduction

Hi, I'm Matt Krause. I'm a Senior Product Manager on the Copilot Extensibility team at Microsoft, and a wanabe developer. I work to assist customers and
partners deploying Copilot extensibility solutions, focusing mostly on Microsoft Graph connectors and Declarative agents. This is my place to share what
I'm working on and what I'm learning about. I'm not great at blogging regulairly, but I hope that I can create something you find useful here.

## Professional Background

Throughout my professional career, I've worn many hats. I got my start as an Exchange admin. During that time I managed large Exchange deployments and
started the process of migrating Exchange systems to Exchange Online (BPOS and Live@edu before the rebrand). I then worked for a managed services provider where
I again ran a multi-tenant Exchange deployment, and worked with smaller financial institutions to virtualize and right-size their server deployments into our
cloud infrastructure.

Once at Microsoft, I started as a Premier Field Engineer (PFE) focused on Exchange online. As Exchange migrations to the cloud started slowing down, I began
focusing on Microsoft Graph. That lead me to the PM role I currently hold. Originally focued on Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Graph Data Connect (MGDC), I
now focus on Microsoft Copilot extensibility.
